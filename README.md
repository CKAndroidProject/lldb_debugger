# Debugger Playground
If you want to debug iOS or macOS, start by reading everything by: https://github.com/DerekSelander/LLDB. His book is ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

### 0. Pro lldb tips
`lldb` was Apple's debugger of choice.

This article contained references to good lldb articles and a few tips to make debugging simpler.

### 1. Code Lifting
This article was written to show xCode and a debugger working together to:
- [x] extract a dynamic framework from an iOS app
- [x] build a new app and invoke the Objective-C code

### 2. Dormant code
This article was written to show:
- [x] Code can be invoked, even if it was not reference in code or by a header file
- [x] Why shipping _dormant code_ was a bad idea
- [x] Why tiny xCode _Build Settings_ matter, when _stripping symbols_ and _dead-code_

### 3a. Objective-C debugging
Learning Objective-C through the eyes of a debugger.

### 3b. C debugging
Playing with C with a debugger.

### 4. üç™üç™  WKWebView Cookie Thief
I wanted to print all cookies from `WKWebView` once somebody had selected the WKWebView screen inside of iOS.

### 5. Facebook's Chisel commands
This was a fun set of python lldb scrupt to re-use. All about the U.I.

### 6. Fake iOS ViewController
I wanted to create a new UIViewController and load it over the top of the screen that was loaded.  This was a workout.  It jumped between Objective-C and Swift context for the debugger.
```
e id $vc = [UIViewController new]
(lldb) po $vc
<UIViewController: 0x1067116e0>
```
### 7. Python lldb interface
This code create a Swift Class with lldb's Python interpreter and reads the memory.

### 8. lldb aliases
You won't get far in iOS / macOS debugging without adding command aliases. These are shorthand commands for your lldb commands.

### 9. Strings in memory
Find a hidden string with lldb Debugger.  This used three lldb commands `section`, `memory find`, `memory read` to find a string inside a _stripped, release app_.

### 10. Swift code
If you  invoked code from a Swift dynamic framework, you hit a lot of traps.  This article was to explain how to avoid traps.

### 11. Code injection
Load a framework - that was not shipped in an app - and instantiate one of the framework's classes.

### 12. Debugger language context
In iOS, an app maybe written in Swift but a lot of the objects still had Objective-C base classes.  This article helps explain the error and fix it.

### 13. Breakpoints & Registers
I wanted to stop at the start of a function call and inspect the parameters passed into the function. üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### 14. Inspect 3rd party SDK
This was lots of fun. ü¶Ç.

### 15. Scripting
A script to see who called the C API `getenv` in a running iOS app.

### 16. Setup macOS for debugging
You need to turn off `Rootless` [ temporarily, at least ] if you want to debug anything interesting.

### 17a. Debug on Jailbroken device
Setup a Jailbroken iOS device for debugging.

### 17b. iOS Jailbreak Bypass
This article demonstrated a bypass of Jailbreak checks that ran immediately when an app launched.

### 18. Threads
I wrote a C program that ran multiple threads.  These threads were not tied together but they called the same function. Each started on a unique, background thread.  The threads started at roughly the same time.

### 18. Heap Overflow
Due to no **Input Validation** or **Overflow Protection** - we overwrote the `instruction pointer` to a function of our choice.  Getting this to work on a Mac was hard.  By default `Clang` added safety flags.  You had to turn them off.
